### Project Description
This project involves building a BMI calculator using arduino uno,ultrasonic sensor,load cell and HX711 module .The ultrasonic sensor measures height,while the load cell and HX711 module measures weight.The arduino processes these inputs to calculate and display the BMI.And also it provides the details of the range of that measure.

.The objective of this project is to develop an arduino based BMI calculator that can The objective of this project is to develop an Arduino-based BMI calculator that can take input for a person's height and weight, compute their BMI, and display it on an LCD screen. Additionally, it will indicate the range in which the calculated BMI falls (underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese) based on established BMI categories. This device aims to be simple, portable, and user-friendly, catering to individuals who need quick access to BMI information in settings such as fitness centers, health clinics, or even at home.
