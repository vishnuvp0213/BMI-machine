### Project Description
This project involves building a BMI calculator using arduino uno,ultrasonic sensor,load cell and HX711 module .The ultrasonic sensor measures height,while the load cell and HX711 module measures weight.The arduino processes these inputs to calculate and display the BMI.And also it provides the details of the range of that measure.

The objective of this project  is to develop an affordable, user-friendly BMI calculator using simple and readily available components intented to provide low cost solution for all individuals at all economic status.

###  The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[Since our aim is to provide low-cost, readily accessible,effective solution ,we are using arduino based BMI calculator.Such that it can provide quick access with real time information to all individuals in an affordable way even from their home.


Way of working:
1.weight measurement:
The load cell, which get connected with a hx711 amplifier or module, can measure the user's weight. The HX711 module is specifically designed to amplify the load cell's output, providing accurate weight data to the Arduino.

2.Height Measurement:

The ultrasonic sensor will measure the user's height. This sensor works by emitting ultrasonic waves and measuring the time taken for the waves to bounce back from the top of the user's head, providing the height.

3. BMI Calculation:

With the weight and height data, the Arduino will calculate BMI using the formula:  Weight (kg)/ Height (m)2

‚Ä¢ The system will then display the calculated BMI, allowing users to understand their weight category and overall health status.

4.Affordability and Accessibility:
As it uses  low-cost components, making  ideal for  limited resources. Using the Arduino Uno as a microcontroller minimizes complexity and keeps the project within a budget- friendly range.

5. User Interaction and Display:

A simple LCD display can be used to show the weight, height, and BMI. The Arduino uno will manage the data  reading, processing,  reading, processing, display of results, making the device easy for anyone to operate.

This solution provides an economical and efficient way to track BMI without the need for expensive equipment, supporting preventive health and self-monitoring.



## Technical Details
Components Used:

Arduino Uno: This microcontroller is the heart of this  BMI calculator, running the code and processing inputs.

Keypad: Used to enter weight(kg) and height(m). 

‚Ä¢ LCD Display (16x2 ): Used to show the entered values and the calculated BMI result. 

Load Cell: To measure weight directly, a load cell with an HX711 amplifier can be integrated for accurate weight measurement.

Ultrasonic Sensor: An ultrasonic sensor like the HC-SR04 can be used to measure height automatically .

Power Supply: The Arduino can be powered via USB or an external battery pack.

2. Programming and Libraries:

Arduino IDE: Used for writing and uploading code to the Arduino.

Libraries:

LiquidCrystal library for interfacing with the LCD display.

Keypad library for working with a matrix keypad.

HX711 library  for interpreting data from the weight sensor.

NewPing library  for handling distance measurements.

3. Code and Logic:

Input Processing:The keypad allows users to enter height (in meters) and weight (kg).
 Arduino will read directly from the sensors and process it.

BMI Calculation:

The formula for BMI is: BMI weight in kg/ (height in meters)¬≤ 

The Arduino calculates BMI based on the input values.

Display Output:

The calculated BMI is displayed on the LCD, along with a classification (like : Underweight, Normal, Overweight or obese) based on BMI ranges.
