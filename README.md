### Project Description
This project involves building a BMI calculator using arduino uno,ultrasonic sensor,load cell and HX711 module .The ultrasonic sensor measures height,while the load cell and HX711 module measures weight.The arduino processes these inputs to calculate and display the BMI.And also it provides the details of the range of that measure.

.The objective of this project is to develop an arduino based BMI calculator that can The objective of this project is to develop an Arduino-based BMI calculator that can take  a person's height and weight as input , calculate their BMI, and display it on an LCD screen. Additionally, it will indicate the range in which the calculated BMI falls (underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese) based on established BMI categories. This device aims to be simple, portable, and user-friendly, catering to individuals who need quick access to BMI information in settings such as fitness centers, health clinics, or even at home.This solution would not only provide a cost-effective alternative to BMI tracking but also promote awareness of healthy body weight maintenance with quick access, and real-time information to people at all economic status

###  The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[This project aims to develop an affordable, user-friendly BMI calculator using an Arduino Uno,  load cell ,HX711 module, and an ultrasonic sensor. This device is intended to provide a low-cost solution for individuals  offering basic health information without expensive equipment. By using simple and readily available components, the system will calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) through the following steps:

1.weight measurement:
The load cell, paired with an HX711 amplifier, will measure the user's weight. The HX711 module is specifically designed to amplify the load cell's output, providing accurate weight data to the Arduino.

2.Height Measurement:

The ultrasonic sensor will measure the user's height. This sensor works by emitting ultrasonic waves and measuring the time taken for the ‚Üì waves to bounce back from the top of the user's head, providing the height.

3. BMI Calculation:

With the weight and height data, the Arduino will calculate BMI using the formula: BMI Weight (kg)/ Height (m)2

‚Ä¢ The system will then display the calculated BMI, allowing users to understand their weight category and overall health status.

4.Affordability and Accessibility:
As it uses  low-cost components, making  ideal for  limited resources. Using the Arduino Uno as a microcontroller minimizes complexity and keeps the project within a budget- friendly range.

5. User Interaction and Display:

A simple LCD display can be used to show the weight, height, and BMI. The Arduino uno will manage the data ‚Üì reading, processing, and display of reading, processing, and display of results, making the device easy for anyone to operate.

This solution provides an economical and efficient way to track BMI without the need for costly equipment, supporting preventive health and self-monitoring.

## Technical Details
Components Used:

Arduino Uno: This microcontroller serves as the core of the BMI calculator, running the code and processing inputs.

Keypad: Used to enter weight and height in Meter. 

‚Ä¢ LCD Display (16x2 ): Used to show the entered values and the calculated BMI result. The CD connects to the ‚Üì Arduino and ca.. uisplay data output.

Load Cell: If you want to measure weight directly, a load cell with an HX711 amplifier can be integrated for accurate weight measurement.

Ultrasonic Sensor (Optional): An ultrasonic sensor like the HC-SR04 can be used to measure height automatically if desired.

Power Supply: The Arduino can be powered via USB or an external battery pack.

2. Programming and Libraries:

Arduino IDE: Used for writing and uploading code to the Arduino.

Libraries:

LiquidCrystal library for interfacing with the LCD display.

Keypad library for working with a matrix keypad.

HX711 library (if using a load cell) for interpreting data from the weight sensor.

NewPing library (if using an ultrasonic sensor) for handling distance measurements.

3. Code and Logic:

Input Processing:The keypad allows users to enter ‚Üì height (in meters) and weight (in
If using sensors (load cell and/or ultrasonic), the Arduino reads these values directly.

BMI Calculation:

The formula for BMI is: BMI weight in kg/ (height in meters)¬≤ 2

The Arduino calculates BMI based on the inputted or measured values.

Display Output:

The calculated BMI is displayed on the LCD, along with a classification (e.g., Underweight, Normal, Overweight ) based on BMI ranges.

4. Additional Features (Optional):

 Classification Messages: Display a message indicating BMI category.

Serial Communication: The Arduino can send data to a connected computer for logging or monitoring via the Serial Monitor.

Error Handling: Implement checks for valid input ranges or sensor errors.

By using Arduino, sensors, and simple C++ programming,  can create a reliable and interactive BMI calculator.
